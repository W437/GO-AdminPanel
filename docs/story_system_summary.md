# Story System Implementation Summary

## Completed Work
- Added database layer for stories, including media and view tracking tables, plus a per-restaurant `stories_enabled` toggle (migrations `2025_07_06_080000_create_stories_tables.php` and `2025_07_06_080100_add_story_flags_to_restaurants_table.php`).
- Introduced `Story`, `StoryMedia`, and `StoryView` models with supporting services (`StoryService`, `StoryFeedService`) that handle publishing, media uploads, view deduplication, and purge jobs.
- Exposed new API surfaces:
  - Public feed (`GET /api/v1/stories`) and view recording endpoint (`POST /api/v1/stories/{story}/view`).
  - Vendor CRUD suite for stories/media under `/api/v1/vendor/stories` guarded by existing vendor auth + policy checks.
- Delivered admin tooling: controller, Blade index, sidebar entry, and module routes so admins can monitor, expire, or disable restaurant stories.
- Wired background automation (`stories:expire` command, queue jobs for media processing/purge) and feature flags/config entries, including environment defaults.
- Added feature tests covering feed exposure and view recording flows, plus updated the planning doc to match the shipped architecture.

## Next Steps
1. Run the new migrations and ensure `.env` story settings are tuned for each environment.
2. Provision queue workers (and FFmpeg when video normalization is desired), then schedule `php artisan stories:expire` every 10 minutes.
3. Re-run the feature tests once a database connection is available (`php artisan test --filter=StoryFeedTest,StoryViewTest`).
4. Coordinate with frontend/mobile teams to consume the new endpoints and provide UX for story creation/consumption.
5. Monitor storage usage and adjust retention/limits as usage patterns emerge.
