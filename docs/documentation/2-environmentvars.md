Run the following commands for installing required things-

Step 1: Update Package Lists

sudo apt update

Step 2: Install Apache

sudo apt install apache2 -y

Step 3: Install MySQL

sudo apt install mysql-server

Step 4: Install PHP

sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql

Step 5: Test PHP Processing

echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/info.php

Step 6: Additional PHP Modules

sudo apt install php-bcmath -y

sudo apt install php-ctype -y

sudo apt install php-json -y

sudo apt install php-mbstring -y

sudo apt install php-openssl -y

sudo apt install php-pdo -y

sudo apt install php-tokenizer -y

sudo apt install php-xml -y

Configure domain/sub-domain

Make sure you have an Apache web server installed. For configuring domain or sub-domain in your VPS server, you must configure a vhost (Virtual Host) configuration file. Follow the steps below to configure vhost config file for both domain or sub-domain-

Step 1: Navigate to Apache Sites Directory

cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/

Step 2: Create a Virtual Host Configuration File

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/your_domain.com.conf

Add the following content:

<VirtualHost *:80>

    ServerAdmin webmaster@your_domain.com

    ServerAlias www.your_domain.com

    ServerName your_domain.com

    DocumentRoot /var/www/your_domain.com/public_html

    <Directory /var/www/your_domain.com/public_html>

        Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks

        AllowOverride All

        Require all granted

    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log

    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

</VirtualHost>

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Step 3: Enable the virtual host configuration file

sudo a2ensite your_domain.com.conf

Step 4: Reload the Apache2 server

sudo systemctl reload apache2

Step 5: Test the Virtual Host

Open your web browser and navigate to http://your_domain.com. You should see your website.

Info

The following configurations are only for UBUNTU distro.
Domain propagation

    Domain propagation refers to the process of updating DNS (Domain Name System) records across the internet, allowing a newly purchased domain or subdomain to become accessible globally.
    To initiate the process, configure an A record for your domain and CNAME record for your subdomain. Alternatively, if preferred, you can opt to create an A record for your subdomain instead of a CNAME record.

Info

Once DNS changes are made, propagation begins. It can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours for DNS changes to propagate worldwide. During this time, some users might see the old site while others see the new one.

TIP

Once your domain is propagated, check from the follow site – https://dnschecker.org/ Recommended tutorial is below 👇
Setup SSL with Certbot on Apache

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is crucial for securing data transmitted between the user’s browser and your web server. Certbot is a free, open-source software tool for automatically managing SSL certificates.

In this guide, we’ll walk through the process of setting up SSL for your Apache web server using Certbot.

Before you begin, make sure you have:

An Apache web server installed.

A registered domain pointing to your server’s IP address.

The domain is accessible over HTTP (port 80).

Step 1: SSH into the server

    Access the server hosting your HTTP website via SSH using a user account with sudo privileges.

Step 2: Install snapd

    Ensure that you install snapd and carefully follow any provided instructions to activate classic snap support.
    Refer to the instructions provided on snapcraft’s website for installing snapd.

install snapd

Step 3: Remove certbot-auto and any Certbot OS packages

    If you have any Certbot packages installed via an OS package manager such as apt, it’s advisable to uninstall them before installing the Certbot snap. This ensures that when you execute the command “certbot,” the snap version is utilized rather than the one from your OS package manager. To remove the certbot from the system run the following command-

sudo apt-get remove certbot

Step 4: Install Certbot

    Execute this command on your machine’s command line to install Certbot.

sudo snap install --classic certbot

Step 5: Prepare the Certbot command

    Run the following instruction on the command line of your machine to ensure that the certbot command can be executed.

sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot

Step 6: Choose how you’d like to run Certbot

    Either get and install your certificates…
    Run this command to get a certificate and have Certbot edit your apache configuration automatically to serve it, turning on HTTPS access in a single step.

sudo certbot --apache

    Or, just get a certificate
    If you’re feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your apache configuration by hand, run this command.

sudo certbot certonly --apache

Step 7: Test automatic renewal

    The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job or systemd timer that will renew your certificates automatically before they expire. You will not need to run Certbot again unless you change your configuration. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this command:

sudo certbot renew --dry-run

Step 8: Confirm that Certbot worked

To confirm that your site is set up properly, visit https://yourwebsite.com/ in your browser and look for the lock icon in the URL bar.

MySQL Database and User Setup

Setting up a MySQL database involves creating a database, creating a user, and assigning that user appropriate privileges. This guide will walk you through the process using MySQL commands.

Before you begin, make sure you have:

MySQL installed on your server.

MySQL root access or a user with sufficient privileges.

Step 1: Log in to MySQL

sudo mysql

Step 2: Create a Database

CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;

Replace your_database_name with the desired name for your database.

Step 3: Create a MySQL User

CREATE USER 'your_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';

Replace your_username with the desired username and your_password with the desired password for the user.

Step 4: Grant All Privileges to the User for the Database

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database_name.* TO 'your_username'@'localhost';

Step 5: Flush the privileges 

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Replace your_database_name with the name of the database created in Step 2 and your_username with the username created in Step 3.

Step 6: Exit MySQL

EXIT;

phpMyadmin setup (optional)

Run the following commands for installing phpmyadmin in your system

sudo apt update

sudo apt install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-zip php-gd php-json php-curl

Here are the options you should choose when prompted in order to configure your installation correctly:

For the server selection, choose apache2

WARNING

When the prompt appears, “apache2” is highlighted, but not selected. If you do not hit SPACE to select Apache, the installer will not move the necessary files during installation. Hit SPACE, TAB, and then ENTER to select Apache.

Select Yes when asked whether to use dbconfig-common to set up the database

You will then be asked to choose and confirm a MySQL application password for phpMyAdmin

Restart the apache2 server-

sudo systemctl restart apache2

Project Setup 

Upload your project in /var/www/your_domain.com/public_html and unzip the file

apt install unzip

unzip your_file_name

Then give permission to some specific files & folders

sudo chmod 777 modules_statuses.json

sudo chmod 755 .env

sudo chmod 777 app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php

sudo chmod -R 777 storage

sudo chmod -R 777 bootstrap/cache

sudo chmod -R 777 resources/lang 

Now you are ready to go for the installation.
