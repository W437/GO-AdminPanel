When creating a new food item, regarding the food type; let's break it into groups of tags so restaurants can multi-select.


1. Diet Type (main ones customers filter by)

Restaurants can choose several.

Non-Vegetarian

Vegetarian

Vegan

Pescatarian (fish/seafood, no meat)

Egg-Free

Dairy-Free

Sugar-Free / No Added Sugar

Low-Carb / Keto-Friendly

High-Protein

Keep “Type of Food” as a primary tag (e.g. Non-Veg / Veg / Vegan / Mixed), and the rest as extra tags.

2. Religious / Ethical Preferences

Super relevant for your market:

Kosher

Halal

No Alcohol


3. Allergy & Intolerance Tags

These matter a lot for filtering:

Gluten-Free

Contains Gluten

Nut-Free

Contains Nuts

Lactose-Free

Soy-Free

Shellfish-Free

Sesame-Free

4. Other Useful Tags

Optional but nice for UX:

Spicy / Mild Options Available

Organic Ingredients

Healthy / Light
